# Rapidly-Growing Random Tree
**Northwestern MS Robotics Hackathon Project**

The project entailed coding an rapidly-growing random tree (RRT), the backbone of robot path planning, in three different assignments. For more detail on RRTs and the tasks, [click here.](http://robotics.mech.northwestern.edu/~elwin/rrt_challenge.html)

1) simplerrt.py: Starting from the center of a 100x100 plot, create an RRT that expands for a finite amount of iterations, with edges measuring one unit in length.

2) circlerrt.py: From a randomized start point, expand an RRT that dodges circles of random placement and radii until the randomized end point is a straight path away. Highlight the path connecting the start to the end.

3) nurrt.py: While dodging the black pixels composing a photo of Northwestern University's N logo, use an RRT to expand from a start point to an end point.
